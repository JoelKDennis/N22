        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12px;">Over the past 15 years, the Allegheny West Foundation (AWF), 
        one of the oldest and most successful CDC's in Philadelphia, has built a reputation as the premier provider of 
        neighborhood-based youth services in Allegheny West. </span><br /><hr />
        This summer was no exception, AWF provided 68 income eligible youth with six week college experience program 
        that helped students master skills required for gaining admission to post secondary education. 
        <br /><br />
        AWF secured on campus space at Villanova University where students participated in rigorous academic sessions designed to help students increase their proficiency in basic subjects. Students also attended SAT prep workshops that improved their test taking skills and prepared them for the SAT exam.
        <br /><br />
        During the course of the program, youth participates in college campus tours sponsored by Christian Education Coalition for African American Leadership (CEECAL) which has partnerships with a large number of colleges and university including a host of Historically Black Colleges.

            In the final week, participants stayed overnight in dormitories area colleges. Their stay gave them a first hand experience of college life. Students completed a college portfolio as part of their academic project. Their portfolio included their research on universities, their career interest inventories, College Admission essay, SAT practice tests and other assignments. Participants also received $360 stipends. 
            <br /><br />
            AWF also employed 70 youth through with its Summer Career Exploration Program. The students were assigned to various job sites in Philadelphia including Tastykake Thrift Outlet, Tastykake baking company and Sneakervilla. Additionally, students completed a program certification process, career portfolios, SAT preparation workshops, and math and literacy workshops. Students visited local colleges and completed research on the credential requirements for selected careers in high-growth areas such as healthcare industry and data management services.

            Another 70 young people worked on doing their part in making a difference in the community through the AWF Service Learning Program. The young people tackled a neglected, filthy and lifeless playground into a colorful mosaic of TLC. The participants cleaned the debris that littered the park. They swept, scrubbed and sanitized. Then they added color. They painted the playground benches and the ground with beautiful colors that enlivened the playground and made it welcoming again. Once the benches were painted, the group with the help of a muralist from the Mural Arts Program began to create a beautiful mural depicting the 22nd street. The mural is located in the playground on the back wall of the recreation center. Thanks to the work of these young people this summer, Panati playground is a little more colorful, a little cleaner and a whole lot better.
