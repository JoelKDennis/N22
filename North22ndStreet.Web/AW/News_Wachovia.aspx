                "We are excited to have the opportunity to partner with Allegheny West Foundation"
                said Denise McGregor Armbrister, Executive Director of the Wachovia Regional Foundation.

                In 2003 the Allegheny West Foundation led a planning process that engaged hundreds
                of local residents, 15 community groups and several dozen service providers to collect
                data on community needs.
