        SWAMPOODLE. This was the name given to the neighborhood the North 22nd Street Business Corridor was developed in. 
        It was a junction of three railroad lines in the vicinity of 22nd and Lehigh avenue before 1926. 
        The North 22nd Street Business Corridor has been in existence since the 1930’s. 
        It was a viable shopping corridor serving the needs of area residents prior to the advent of supermarkets and shopping centers. 
        It was also the home of Shibe Park were the Philadelphia Phillies and A’s played there home games. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition there were several local factories surrounding the corridor that employed more than 10,000 people. 
        These workers shopped and banked on the local business corridor. Business was bustling. 
        The restaurants flourished with breakfast and lunch business. Dry goods retailers were busy from Wednesday to Saturday every week. 
        All businesses were family owned, mom and pop stores.
        </p>
        <p>
        Initially there was no competition for business, 
        however there was some competition for business from the downtown department stores, 
        which neighborhood residents infrequently shopped. So for the next 30 years or more business remained stable. 
        Over the years the dynamics of consumer shopping changed. In the late 60’s shopping centers were being built. 
        More people had automobiles and since these centers offered free parking, 
        and offered clusters of stores with anchor department stores the tendency for many was to go to these locations for shopping. 
        Add to this the large base of industrial companies surrounding the corridor that either moved or closed their doors due to the economy in the early 70’s, 
        caused a tremendous loss of clientele that negatively affected the corridor. 
        </p>
        <p>
        In 1971 the Phillies moved to Veteran’s Stadium in South Philadelphia and Shibe Park closed down. 
        The surrounding neighborhood changed ethnically, and there were demands for different kinds of products that were not being offered. 
        The business owners who now were mostly seniors, did not want to invest in change and between the late 60’s and 70’s closed their doors. 
        Some businesses were sold, but a number of buildings especially in the 2800 block of 22nd street were abandoned and left to deteriorate. 
        Instead of a bustling five block commercial strip only 1 ½ blocks were vibrant.

        North 22nd Street needed to become more self sustaining. If the corridor was going to survive, 
        there needed to be a plan in place to revitalize the complete five block business corridor. 
        The Allegheny West Foundation developed a plan to focus on developing and implementing 
        this revitalization under the North 22nd Street Revitalization Program, focusing on the 2800 block of north 22nd street.
        </p>
        <p>
        Nine properties were acquired and with the use of grants and private funding, these properties were completely rehabbed to mixed use commercial properties. 
        All of these properties have been sold to business owners and private investors who have viable commercial tenants in all of them. 
        A private developer built an anchor strip mall at the gateway to north 22nd street from the south at 22nd and Lehigh bringing in 3 key anchor businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
        Private developers were attracted to north 22nd street, and many acquired vacant properties and have developed them, 
        mostly with private funding assisted by grants. There are five major projects in development and predevelopment stage 
        targeted at bringing in anchor businesses to North 22nd street. In addition a new street scape plan has been proposed and is in the planning stage.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Main Street Program has been essential in tying these accomplishments together by assisting with technical and financial assistance. 
        Existing businesses have been encouraged to improve their facades with the same kind of assistance. As a result north 22nd street has become 
        a self sustaining commercial corridor due to private investment along with grant programs, the involvement of the Allegheny West Foundation, 
        the Main Street Program, PCDC, Philadelphia Department of Commerce and other programs designed to assist commercial corridors.
        </p>
        <p>
        There is a strong Merchant Association Board that is interconnected with all Main Street Committees. We are focusing on helping existing 
        businesses improve their facades and retaining some struggling existing businesses along with marketing for new niche businesses. 
        The local bank on the corridor has bought into actively assisting merchants on the corridor with financing to facilitate our efforts. 
        We welcome any entrepreneurs who are looking to establish or expand their business to North 22nd Street. Contact the Main Street Manager 
        if you have interest at 215 221 8836.
